# William-BillOrganizer
This is William! The bill organizing bot.
He takes in user input, "Bill name," "Bill Price," and "Person who paid" and calculates the amount that each of the housemates owe.
Uses SQLite3 library for a data base and tkinter for GUI purposes. 

This bot is made specifically for my living situation, with my housemates names and our custom splits for bills and rent, but can be eeasily modified.
Coded in Python
